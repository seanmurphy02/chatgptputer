(Verse 1)
Beneath the indigo sky, where the moonlight softly sighs,
On the canvas of the night, stars are painting with their light.
Oh, the whisper of the breeze, and the rustling of the trees,
They compose a lullaby, for the universe and I.

(Chorus)
Starry night, oh, how bright you shine,
In your light, all the world's divine.
Every glimmer, every spark, lightens up the endless dark,
Starry night, in your arms, Iâ€™m fine.

(Verse 2)
See the constellations gleam, in this celestial dream,
Galaxies afar, narrate tales of every star.
Shooting stars, they flit and sway, in a cosmic ballet,
Underneath their glow, secrets only night could know.

(Chorus)
Starry night, oh, you hold my heart,
In your cloak, I find my art.
Every twinkle, every blaze, sets my weary soul ablaze,
Starry night, in your peace, I start.

(Bridge)
Shadow and the light, dance together in the night,
In the silent serenade, a symphony is played.
Dreams are taking flight, under the watchful starlight,
In the quietude they rise, to meet the starry skies.

(Chorus)
Starry night, a canvas so wide,
In your depths, my dreams reside.
Every flicker, every flash, echoes of the cosmic clash,
Starry night, in your mystery, I hide.

(Outro)
As dawn begins to break, and the world starts to wake,
The stars, they fade away, until the end of day.
But in my heart remains, the melody of their refrains,
Starry night, until we meet again, stay.
