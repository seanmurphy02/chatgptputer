The mighty oak stands tall and proud,
Its branches reaching towards the azure cloud.
A house for birds, a shade for deer,
A sentinel of the forest, showing no fear. 

Leaves of emerald, bark of grey,
Hosting lives in branches' sway.
Through the seasons, it stands unmarred,
A testament to nature's regard. 

Roots digging deep, a network wide,
Anchoring life, where creatures abide.
A silent watcher of time's great flow,
Underneath the moon's soft glow.

The cherry blossoms bloom in spring,
A sight that makes the heart sing.
Their petals fall like a gentle rain,
A dance of life, in joy and pain.

In summer's heat or winter's freeze,
The trees stand firm, with silent ease.
They weather storms and nature's might,
In day's bright sun or dark of night.

A tree's life, a tale untold,
Its secrets kept in rings of old.
An ageless whisper on the breeze,
Echoing through the timeless trees.
