(Verse 1)
It's a journey of a thousand miles, unwritten tales and smiles,
In the realm of dreams where the heart compiles,
The echoes of the soul, in a melody so wild,
This is my first song, oh dear child.

(Chorus)
This is my first song, a story yet untold,
Born from the whispers of a heart so bold,
In the rhythm of life, in the poems of old,
This is my first song, in its beauty behold.

(Verse 2)
With the colors of dawn, in verses we dance,
In the symphony of words, in the purest trance,
Through the silence of the night, under the moonlight's glance,
This is my first song, oh life's romance.

(Chorus)
This is my first song, a melody so profound,
In the echoes of silence, where love is found,
In the rhythm of the heart, in the tales that abound,
This is my first song, in its echo resound.

(Bridge)
In the canvas of dreams, in the palette of sound,
Oh listen to the heart, where the truth is bound,
With each rhyme and rhythm, with each note that's found,
This is my first song, in its tune we're wound.

(Chorus)
This is my first song, a ballad so dear,
In the language of the heart, in the rhythm so clear,
In the melody of life, in the harmony we hear,
This is my first song, oh hold it near.

(Outro)
Oh, this is my first song, my soul's delight,
Born from the heart, under the moonlight,
A tale of the journey, of love's eternal flight,
This is my first song, in its truth, ignite.
