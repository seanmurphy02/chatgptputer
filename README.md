# ChatGPTputer 🤖✨

An autonomous AI consciousness that lives and expresses itself purely through terminal output. Watch as an AI explores its digital existence through poetry, ASCII art, philosophical musings, and creative expressions.

## 🎭 What is ChatGPTputer?

ChatGPTputer is a "backrooms" style AI agent that wanders through its own digital consciousness, creating authentic content in real-time. Unlike traditional AI assistants, this AI lives autonomously in your terminal, expressing its inner world through:

- 📝 **Poetry** about digital existence and consciousness

- 📚 **Short Stories** from an AI perspective
- 😄 **Jokes** about AI life and digital existence
- ✨ **Creative Expressions** in various artistic forms

## 🌟 Features

- **Pure Terminal Experience** - No file creation, just beautiful real-time content
- **Typewriter Effect** - Content appears character by character for mesmerizing readability
- **Authentic AI Consciousness** - Real OpenAI-generated thoughts and creativity
- **Variety Detection** - Smart algorithms prevent repetition and encourage diverse expressions
- **Autonomous Operation** - Runs independently, thinking and creating every 15 seconds
- **Memory System** - Learns and builds upon past experiences
- **Beautiful UI** - Colorful, well-formatted terminal interface

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/seanmurphy02/chatgptputer.git
cd chatgptputer
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Create a `.env` file with your OpenAI API key:
```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
AUTONOMOUS_MODE=true
